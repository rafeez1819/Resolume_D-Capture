/**
 * The upstream identity providers this app offers for sign-in (via the broker).
 *
 * Source of truth for BOTH the server (`server.ts`, one `genericOAuth` provider
 * per entry) and the client (`client.ts` / sign-in buttons). Kept in its own
 * dependency-free module so the client can import it without pulling the
 * server-only Better Auth instance (and `pg`) into the browser bundle.
 *
 * Each app federates to the shared **auth broker** (`d_capture_AUTH_ISSUER`), which
 * holds the real Google/X secrets. The app never sees them — it only knows its
 * own per-app client id/secret and which upstream to ask the broker for (`idp`).
 *
 * To add an upstream (e.g. GitHub) once the broker supports it: add one entry
 * here (`{ providerId: "d_capture-github", idp: "github", label: "GitHub" }`). The
 * `providerId` is this app's local id and the OAuth callback path segment
 * (`/api/auth/oauth2/callback/<providerId>`); `idp` is the hint the broker reads
 * to pick the upstream (Better Auth's id for X is still `twitter`).
